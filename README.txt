1. The architecture and hyperparameters selected for your best
classification model (number of hidden layers, number of neurons in
hidden layers, activation functions, number of iterations for training,
etc.):

Number of layers: 1
Dense parametres: 50, activation: hard_sigmoid
Epoch number: 2
Optimizer: Adamax
Model: Functional model

2. The vector representation of the input texts: number of features, type
of features (BoW unigrams, bi-grams, etc.), word
filtering/normalization/lemmatiszation, etc, type of vectorizer (Count-
based, binary, TF-IDF):

Uni-bigram: (1,2)
Word_tokenize, Lemmatization, CountVectorizer, no stopwords.

3. The accuracy measure of your best classifier model:

Accuracy: 0.8097
